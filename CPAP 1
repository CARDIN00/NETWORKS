## 7 Application:
Interface bw the user application and the user
the user interacts with the application which interacts with the protocol
FTP,HTTP/S, POP3, SMTP, TELNET

VULNERABILITIES::


## 6 Presentation:
Controls the formatting and the syntax of the user data for the application.
Ensures the data can be understood by the reciever.
#### If two devices do not support the same formate or syntax then the layer can provide the conversion or translation service
Performs Encryption and Compressoin.

## 5 Session:
Establish , mantain and terminate the session bw the users.


##### till layer 5 from 7 are the upper layers: i.e, they handle the appliaction level functions, interact with the user.
## 4 Transport:
Reliable transfer of Data by ensuring that the date reaches the destination error free, not the actual data transfer.
#### TCP 
connection oriented
#### UDP
connection-less

## 3 Network:
Controls the internetwork communucation
TWO KEYS:
LOGICAL ADDRESSING
provides unique address the identifier that identifie both the host and the network that the host exists on.
ROUTING
determines the best parth for the data packets to travle
## 2 Data-link:
Responsible for transporing data "WITHIN" the network.
## 1 Physical ;
