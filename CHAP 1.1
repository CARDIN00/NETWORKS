VULNERABILITIES AT EACH LAYER:

# Apploication layer:
::Direct interface bw the end uer applications and email , file transfer , web browsing and remote logins:
::It does not reffer to the applications themselves bu the protocols that the applicatoins use to communicate over the network:

http/s,  ssh, telnet , ftp, SFTP, DNS

:::::COMMON VULNERABILITIES:
INJECTION ATTACKS:
CROSS SITE SCRIPTING:
CROSS SITE REQUEST FORGERY:
DIRECOTRY TRAVERSAL:

# PRESENTATION LAYER:
::Responsibe for transfering data , encrypting it and comressing it for the lower level layers/
:: Ensures that the data sent by the application layer of one system is readable by the application layer of the other.

JPEG/JPG, GIF,ASCII,JSON,MP4, SSL/TLS

SSL/TLS :(Secure socket layer/Transort layer security) : are the cryptographic protocols that ensure safe communication over a network.

::::::VULNERABILITIES:
Acceping the self signed certificates without user warning (Digital certificatios that applroves the sserver's identity).
Weak or broken encryption.


# SESSION LAYER:
::Manages and Controls the dialogue(Session) between two computers.
::Responsible for establishing and mentaining and terminating the connections between the application.
::Ensures that the sessions are synchronized and organized.

::::::VULNERABILITIES:
1::  SESSION HIJACKING ,
2::  SESSION FIXATION,(Attacker sets a known session ID and tricks a victim into using it. Once the victim logs in, attacker uses the same ID to access the account.)
3:: INSECURE SESSION TOKEN GENERATION

# TRANSPORT LAYER:
:: Rensponsible for end to end to end communication, reliable date transfer, error recovery.
:: Ensure that the data is delivered accurately.

UDP, TCP.

:::::: VULNERABILITIES ::
TCP SYN Flood (DoS attack)
UDP Flood,(Massive volume of the UDP packets to the random ports overwhelming the systems)
Port Scanning
Fragmentation Attacks

# Network Layer
Responsible for Routing the packets.
Determines the best parth for the packerts.
Handles LOGICAL ADDRESSING ( Logical addressing refers to assigning unique IP addresses to devices on a network so they can be identified and located across different networks.)

IP (Internet Protocol): IPv4, IPv6, 
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used by ping, traceroute
IGMP,
RIP
