# HUBS (REPEATERS)
Layer 1 devices
physically connect devices together for communication.
No intelligent forwarding.
Forward every FRAME to "every" Port.


# SWITCHES
Layer 2 devices.
Contain:: 1: Hardware address for hosts
               2: the port each harware address is associated with.
the Layer 2 devices will make intelligent forwarding decisionsbased on the  data_link headers.
A frame can then be forwarded out only to the appropriate destination port.


# ROUTERS
Layer -3 device:
Forwards the packets from one Network to another Network.
BASED ON THE DESTINATION "NETWORK" NOT THE DESTINATION HOST


# Layer-3 Switching vs. Layer-3 Routing
Layer 3 switching:
can perfrom the layer 2 protocols as well as the layer 3 protocols.
Generally have the higher port densities than the routers.
Optimized for the Ethernet. Predominantly user for INTRA-VLAN rouing
Uses as the backbone on the LAN or campus level network

Layer 3 Routers:
Support more advanced feature sets.
Support Large number of WAN technologies.
Used on the Network parameters, connecting WAN environments.
