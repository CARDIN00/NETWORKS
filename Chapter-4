#### Hardware Addressing
A hardware address is used to uniquely identify a host within a local
network. Hardware addressing is a function of the Data-Link layer of the
OSI model (Layer-2).

# IP
:::A core function of IP is to provide logical addressing for hosts
:::An IPaddress provides a hierarchical structure to both uniquely identify a host,
and what network that host exists on.


## IPv4 Addressing

## The Subnet Mask
Provides the distinctions to which part of the IP identifies the "network"
and which part identifies the "host".


## SUBNETTING:
(SKIPPING THE BITS IS NOT ALLOWED IN SUBNET MASKS)

Creating the new networks by Stealing Bits from the :::host::: portion of the subnet mask.

EXAMPLE:
The default Class C mask (255.255.255.0) looks as
follows in binary:
11111111.1111111.1111111.00000000
::::There are a total of 24 bits set to 1, which are used to identify the network.
There are a total of 8 bits set to 0, which are used to identify the host, and
these host bits can be stolen.
Stealing just means to change the host bits set to "0" to to network bits "1"

# Private vs. Public IPv4 Addresses
In response to shortening number of available IPv4 addresses, a specific subset of the IPv4 address space was designated as private, to temporarily alleviate this problem.

A public address can be routed on the Internet. Thus, hosts that must be
Internet-accessible must be configured with (or reachable by) public
addresses. Allocation of public addresses is governed by the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

 A private address is intended for internal use within a home or
organization, and can be freely used by anyone. However, private addresses
can never be routed on the Internet. In fact, Internet routers are configured to
immediately drop traffic with private addresses.
