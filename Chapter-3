STP :
develped to orevent the broadcast storm caused by the switchig loops.
::
The switches that run the STP will build the MAP of entire switching network.
STP will identify if there is any loops, and then disable or block as many blocks as necessary to eleminate the loops in the topology.

:::STP switches exchange the bridge protocol data units(BPDU) to build the topology of the database.

Electing an STP Root Bridge
The first step in the STP convergence process is electing a Root Bridge,
which is the central reference point for the STP topology. As a best practice,
the Root Bridge should be the most centralized switch in the STP topology.
A Root Bridge is elected based on its Bridge ID, comprised of two
components in the original 802.1D standard:
• 16-bit Bridge priority
• 48-bit MAC address
The default priority is 32,768, and the lowest priority wins. If there is a tie
in priority, the lowest MAC address is used as the tie-breaker.
